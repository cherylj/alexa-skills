# Friendly Facts Privacy Policy
## What do we collect?
Friendly Facts asks users for their first name.  In the case where there are multiple people with the same first name, you will be prompted for your last name as well.  This does not have to be your legal name.  It is intended to be a way for other users in your group to identify you.

## How is this information used?
This information is solely used to associate a name with a fact given to the Friendly Facts skill.  I do not provide access to your information to any other party.

## How can I remove my information?
Games which are inactive for 24 hours may be automatically deleted.  If you would like your information deleted, simply ask Friendly Facts to remove your game.  All information associated with your game will be deleted.

## What if I have other questions?
If you have other questions, you can contact me via email at cheryl 47 @ gmail . com.
